Simple raylib 5.5 template for Zig that uses the actual C version of raylib.

Thanks to 'Coding with Sphere' for helping me set this up!

I've provided a simple makefile that lets you set some settings and build the project easier.
Note that it's just a wrapper for build.zig, it doesn't do any compiling.

Alternativley, you can run 'zig build' (or 'zig build run' to also run it), and output will be in zig-out/bin/!
